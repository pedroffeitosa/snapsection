# SnapSection

SnapSection is a Python-based tool that automates the process of capturing screenshots of specific sections of a webpage. It leverages Selenium WebDriver to interact with webpages, scroll to desired sections, and save screenshots of these sections for further analysis or documentation.

## Features

- Automatically identifies and captures screenshots of `section` elements on a webpage.
- Fallback to `div` elements if no `section` elements are found.
- Ensures elements are visible and loaded before capturing screenshots.
- Saves each screenshot with a unique filename in a designated folder.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.
- **Chrome browser** installed.
- **ChromeDriver** corresponding to your Chrome version installed. [Download ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
- **Selenium** library installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/snapsection.git
    cd snapsection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver for your version of Chrome and place it in the project directory. Ensure the path to `chromedriver.exe` is correctly set in the code.

## Usage

1. Modify the `main.py` file to set the URL of the website you want to capture.

    ```python
    url = "https://www.example.com"  # Replace with the desired website URL
    ```

2. Run the application.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The screenshots will be saved in the `screenshots` folder within the project directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: The script takes fewer screenshots than expected.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that all elements are loaded properly. The script includes waits and visibility checks to handle dynamic content, but you may need to increase wait times or modify the code to suit specific webpage behaviors.

- **Issue**: `SessionNotCreatedException` error related to ChromeDriver.
  - **Solution**: Make sure your ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version. You can download the correct version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

- **Issue**: Element not visible or zero height errors when capturing screenshots.
  - **Solution**: The element might not be fully loaded or visible on the page. Consider adding more scroll actions or increasing wait times before capturing screenshots.
